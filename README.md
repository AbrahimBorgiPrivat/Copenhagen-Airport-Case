# Project Structure Overview

This repository is organized into four main directories, each serving a specific purpose in the project workflow:

---

### `/source/`
Contains all relevant python scripts, modules, or automation logic used in the project. It also contains the generated reports and semanticmodels and the visual elements (png,img) used in the reporting.  
 
---

### `/docs/`
Holds manuals, design notes, project descriptions, and other written documents that support understanding or onboarding.

---

### `/resources/`
Used to store raw data files and resources consumed by the project.

---

### `/workspaces/`

---

Each folder is structured to keep development, data, and reporting cleanly separated for better maintainability and clarity.
